When working with this project, follow these rules:

- NEVER do anything i didn't ask you for!
- Use double quotes ("") for strings.
- Do NOT "test the implementation" when you are done. The only exception is when you 
  need to typecheck or build the app, in that case:

  - To typecheck, run "npm run frontend:typecheck".
  - To build, run "npm run frontend:build".
