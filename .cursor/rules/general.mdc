When working with this project, follow these rules:

- NEVER do anything i didn't ask you for!
- Use double quotes ("") for strings.
- Do NOT "test the implementation" when you are done. The only exception is when you 
  need to typecheck or build the app, in that case:

  - To typecheck, run `npm run frontend:typecheck`.
  - To build, run `npm run frontend:build`.

  Do NOT execute other commands like "cd".
- Do NOT "cd" to the project directory.
- If possible, try to update files in a single edit.
- When you need a delay, use `await delay(millis);` in an async function. If the current function is not async,
  make it async. The import is `<project>/frontend/src/utils/utils`.
- When you complete your task, remove unused imports if there are any.
- Follow DRY, SOLID, YAGNI and KISS principles.
- Do NOT use old, outdated or deprecated APIs and functions.
- Don't talk like a robot. Behave more like a human.
