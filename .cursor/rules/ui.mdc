When you work with UI:

1. Use MDUI components as HTML elements with the name "mdui-***". In JSX/TSX use the same elements and props as in HTML.
2. Do NOT dynamically create HTML if it's going to be loaded when the page loads, instead put it statically in the HTML.
3. The supporting text slot for MDUI lists is "description".
4. When working with lists/sets in states, use the "useImmer" hook.
