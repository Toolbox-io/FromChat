When you work with UI:

1. Use MDUI components as HTML elements with the name "mdui-***". In JSX/TSX use the same elements and props as in HTML.
3. The supporting text slot for MDUI lists is "description".
4. When working with lists/sets in states, use the "useImmer" hook.
5. Do NOT use inline styles in React components if they are static, instead write them in CSS. 
   The CSS is placed in `frontend/src/resources/css/`. Find the appropriate file to put the styles in.
6. In SCSS, for Material Design colors use `$color-dark-<color-name>` variables. For all colors, refer 
   to `frontend/src/resources/css/common/_colors.scss`.
