When you work with UI:

1. Use MDUI components through the wrapper: `@/utils/material`. If the component you want to use is missing in that wrapper,
   add it. Do NOT remove anything.
3. The supporting text slot for MDUI lists is "description".
4. When working with lists/sets in states, use the "useImmer" hook.
5. Do NOT use inline styles in React components if they are static, instead write them in CSS.
   Find the appropriate file to put the styles in, or create a new one.
6. In SCSS, for Material Design colors use `$color-dark-<color-name>` variables. For all colors, refer 
   to `frontend/src/css/_material.scss`.
